## Introduction

differential_privacy module includes three files: defense.py, dp_engine.py, eps_log.py

**defense.py** includes some model and manage functions:

* check if model is compatible
* modify model for opacus
* create engine and attach
* calculate privacy spent

**dp_engine.py** includes main algorithms for differential privacy:

* hook
* add noise
* calculate spent

**eps_log.py** includes recording functions:

* privacy parameters
* epsilon in training process

## Usage

In `differential_privacy.sh`, add follow parameters:
  * --differential_privacy\
      use differential privacy module
  * --dp_sigma\
      noise multiplier parameter
  * --dp_delta\
      fault tolerance in epsilon - delta differential privacy 
  * --grad_norm\
      gradient clipping parameter, norm number
